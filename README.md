# Builder Pattern🏗️
[![](https://skills.thijs.gg/icons?i=java)](https://skills.thijs.gg)


## Overview🔎

This repository contains three Java classes: `Menu`, `MenuBuilder`, and `Main`, which together demonstrate a simple menu management system.

## Menu Class📋

The `Menu` class represents an item on a menu with its name and price. It provides methods to retrieve the name and price of a menu item.

## MenuBuilder Class🔧

The `MenuBuilder` class is responsible for building and managing menus for food and drinks. It allows the addition of food and drink items to separate menus, printing the entire menu, and calculating the total bill based on selected food and drink items.

## Main Class📦

The `Main` class demonstrates the usage of the `MenuBuilder` class. It initializes a `MenuBuilder` object, adds food and drink items to the menu, prints the menu, defines the client's ordering, calculates the total bill, and prints the final bill.

## Learning📖 
With this code, I learned how to iterate over Map objects using HashMap. Moreover, I was able to review the builder pattern structure and the concepts of Object-Oriented programming in Java.
